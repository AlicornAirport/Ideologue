    <h2 style"text-align:center"><em>Another</em> political affiliation quiz?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Well, kind of. Based off of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a>, Ideologue is a semi-comprehensive tool to help you better find sociopolitical ideologies that align with your values. Political quizzes (especially axis quizzes) can be a little reductive, so this isn't meant to fully describe everything you believe in, just to help you better put your beliefs into words, and maybe help you find more like-minded people. Please answer honestly!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like every political axis quiz, there are 2 versions: a full version with 20+ questions per axis, and a short one with 5 per axis. You can take whichever one you want, but the full version is a lot more accurate.</p>

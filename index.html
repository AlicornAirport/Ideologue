    <h2 style"text-align:center"><em>Another</em> political affiliation quiz?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Well, kind of. Based off of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a>, Ideologue is a semi-comprehensive tool to help you better find sociopolitical ideologies that align with your values.</p> 
        <br>        
        <p>Political quizzes (especially axis quizzes) can be a little reductive, so this isn't meant to fully describe everything you believe in, just to help you better put your beliefs into words, and maybe help you find more like-minded people. Please answer honestly!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike most of these quizzes, we're not telling you what the axes are just yet, to preserve as much accuracy as we can.</p>
